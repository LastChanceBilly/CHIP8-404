# CHIP8266
This is a Chip-8 emulator for the esp8266 and arduino compatible microcontrollers.
## Why?
This is a frist step into making a variarity of emulators for (hopefuly) many other systems like the VIC 20, Atari 2600 and NES.

And also, I always wanted to write my own emulators, and chip 8 it's a relatively easy system to "emulate".
