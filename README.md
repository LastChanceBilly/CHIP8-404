# CHIP8-404
This is a Chip-8 emulator (Virtual enviroment).
## Why?
This is a frist step into making a variarity of emulators for (hopefuly) many other systems like the VIC 20, Atari 2600 and NES.

And also, I always wanted to write my own emulators, and chip 8 it's a relatively easy system to "emulate".

#### Update: 
This was suppose to be an emulator for the ESP8266, but since I've been a little busy with other porjects I decided to leave this(For now...). But I'll be adding SDL support later on, so at least there's that.
